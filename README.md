Greedy Player:

The greedy AI player buys and steals monsters based on a belief of fair value. It attempts to buy the best monster it can 
for fair value, and steals a monster if it is being bought for significantly less than fair value. It places monsters on 
castles that are closest in points, making up point deficits or extending point leads.
